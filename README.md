For each point ID, there corresponds two rows. The first row is the magnitude, the second row is the phase. Note that both these rows correspond to the same point id.

T1, T2, T3, R1, R2 and R3 correspond to spatial and rotational information about the vectors.

For brevity, ignore the rest of the information in the file and parse the following.

- [ ] FREQUENCY
- [ ] POINT ID and the corresponding T and R columns (both magnitude and phase)

And write this information to a csv file with the following columns:

```
  [ 
  "point_id", "frequency",
  "t1_magnitude", "t1_phase", "t2_magnitude", "t2_phase", "t3_magnitude", "t3_phase", 
  "r1_magnitude", "r1_phase", "r2_magnitude", "r2_phase", "r3_magnitude", "r3_phase"
  ] 
```

Feel free to fork this repo and provide the solution.

That is all.

Do not use any third-party libraries to parse this file. Rely on the simplest logic.
